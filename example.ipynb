      "To use this code repository, you need to clone the repository using the command \"git clone https://github.com/smol-ai/developer\" and copy over the \".example.env\" file to \".env\" while filling in your API keys. There are no Python dependencies to manage thanks to using Modal as a self-provisioning runtime. However, this project uses three waitlisted things: Modal.com, GPT-4 API, and Anthropics Claude 100k context API. You can run this project without Modal by following the instructions in the documentation. Once you have set up the repository, you can prompt for whole program synthesis using Markdown and copy-paste programming. You can also debug the codebase using the \"debugger.py\" script, which reads the entire codebase to make specific code change suggestions.\n",

Notice that AI is only used as long as it is adding value - once it gets in your way, just take over the codebase from your smol junior developer with no fuss and no hurt feelings.

       "## Practical Use Case for Code2Prompt Library\n",
       "\n",
       "The Code2Prompt library is a powerful tool for generating code based on natural language prompts. One practical use case for this library is in the development of Chrome extensions. With Code2Prompt, developers can generate a complete Chrome extension by simply providing a prompt that describes the desired functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "To demonstrate this use case, we have provided an example Chrome extension in the `/generated` and `/exampleChromeExtension` folders. This extension was generated entirely from a prompt specified in `prompt.md`. The extension reads the current page, and offers a popup UI that has the page title+content and a textarea for a prompt (with a default value we specify). When the user hits submit, it sends the page title+content to the Anthropic Claude API along with the up to date prompt to summarize it. The user can modify that prompt and re-send the prompt+content to get another summary view of the content.\n",
       "\n",
       "To generate your own Chrome extension using Code2Prompt, simply run the following command:\n",
       "\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "modal run main.py --prompt \"a Chrome extension that, when clicked, opens a small window with a page where you can enter a prompt for reading the currently open page and generating some response from openai\"\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "After running this command, the generated directory will contain a complete Chrome extension that meets the specifications of the prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Sample Prompt File\n",
       "\n",
       "To help developers get started with Code2Prompt, we have provided a sample prompt file in `prompt.md`. This file contains a prompt that generates the example Chrome extension described above. Developers can modify this prompt to generate Chrome extensions with different functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "```md\n",
       "You are an AI developer who is trying to write a program that will generate code for the user based on their intent.\n",
       "\n",
       "When given their intent, create a complete, exhaustive list of filepaths that the user would write to make the program.\n",
       "\n",
       "Only list the filepaths you would write, and return them as a python list of strings. Do not add any other explanation, only return a python list of strings.\n",
       "\n",
       "A Chrome extension that, when clicked, opens a small window with a page where you can enter a prompt for reading the currently open page and generating some response from openai.\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "By modifying this prompt, developers can generate Chrome extensions with different functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Future Directions\n",
       "\n",
       "Code2Prompt is a powerful tool with many potential use cases. Some future directions for this library include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Specifying .md files for each generated file, with further prompts that could finetune the output in each of them.\n",
       "- Bootstrapping the `prompt.md` for existing codebases - write a script to read in a codebase and write a descriptive, bullet pointed prompt that generates it.\n",
       "- Ability to install its own dependencies.\n",
       "- Self-healing by running the code itself and use errors as information for reprompting.\n",
       "- Using Anthropic as the coding layer.\n",
       "- Making agents that autonomously run this code in a loop/watch the prompt file and regenerate code each time, on a new git branch."
